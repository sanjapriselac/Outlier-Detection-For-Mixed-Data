# Outlier Detection for Mixed-attribute Data

Author: Sanja Priselac 

The code for implementing a selection of available unsupervised outlier detection techniques for data with mixed attributes. 

The implementation of the corresponding methods is based on the following papers:
 * *POD*: "An Effective Pattern Based Outlier Detection Approach for Mixed Attribute Data" (DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-17432-2_13)
 * *ABOD*: "Association-based outlier detection for mixed data‚Äù (DOI 10.17485/ijst/2015/v8i25/80260)
 * *FAMDAD*: "Factor analysis of mixed data for anomaly detection" (DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2005.12129)
 * *PCA_T2*: "Outlier Detection using PCA mix based T2 Control Chart for continuous and categorical data" (DOI 10.1080/03610918.2019.1586921)
 * *ZDisc_KMeans*: "Implementation of Numerical Attribute Discretization for Outlier Detection on Mixed Attribute Data Set" (DOI 10.1109/ICOIACT.2018.8350795)

The code is implemented in the R programming language.
